# Peripheral

We provide a range of peripherals that can be integrated with our robotic platforms. These peripherals are designed to enhance the capabilities of the robots, which include sensors, computing units, power modules, and other components that can be easily added to the robot's configuration. Each peripheral is carefully selected and tested to ensure compatibility and optimal performance with our robotic systems.
