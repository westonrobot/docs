# Robot Maintenance

## Tire

**Important:** Regular tire checking is particularly important for
skid-steer robots (e.g. Scout). Failing to keep the tires in good
condition may lead to robot performance degrade (due to friction change)
or even damages to the mechanical structure.

* Check the tire pressure regularly (for robots using inflated tires)
  -   **Scout 2.0** or later: keep the pressure between **1.8-2.0 Bar**
  -   **Hunter 2.0**: keep the pressure around **0.8 Bar**
* Please replace worn tires in time to avoid further damages to the robot

## Battery

**Important:** When charging the robot, please connect the charger to
the robot first, and then connect the charger to the power outlet. After
finishing charging, disconnect the charger from the power outlet first,
then disconnect the charging connector from the robot.

- Do not overly discharge the battery. The robot will emit an alarm in the case of low battery level. Please charge the battery in time
- Do not charge the robot near any flammable materials
- Do not leave the robot charging unattended. Please disconnect the charger after the batter is fully charged
- Do not use any charger other than the one provided with the robot
- Do not modify or replace the original batteries
- Please charge the robot at least once every two months if the robot is not used for a long time
