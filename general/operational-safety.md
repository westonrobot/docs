# Operational Safety

:::warning Safety Warning

Operating robotics equipment involves inherent risks, including
potential harm to operators or bystanders if not handled properly. It is
essential for all users, both new and experienced, to thoroughly read
and understand the manufacturer's documentation and receive proper
training before operating any robotics machinery. Failure to comply with
these precautions can result in severe injury or damage.

:::

Operation Environment
---------------------

Most robots contain batteries, motors, and other electrical components
that can be hazardous if not handled properly. It is essential to
operate the robot in a safe environment to prevent accidents and damage
to the robot. The following guidelines should be followed when operating
the robot:

-   Do not place the robot near heaters or heating elements
-   Do not use the robot in an environment with corrosive and flammable
    gases or combustible substances
-   Unless specially customized, the general robot models are not
    waterproof and shall not be operated in places with excessive
    humidity

Software Development
--------------------

It's recommend to put the robot on a stable stool or bench that lifts the
robot up so that you don't get unanticipated robot movement even when
wrong motion commands are sent to the robot.

Keep the RC controller off when you're not intending to control the
robot. Mishandling of the remote controller may lead to unexpected robot
movement and cause damage to the robot or its surrounding properties.
