## 4. FAQ

1. **Can the robot stand on its own?**   
    A: From a lying position, the G1 can stand on its own. However, this mode is not recommended as it may damage the joints from excessive use and the robot may fall on smooth floors. It is recommended to have the robot stand from a seated or hanging position instead. 

2. **Q: Does the robot support wireless development?**   
    A: The robot's internal development PC can connect to WiFi networks for internet access (see [G1 Internet Access Guide](/tutorial/unitree/g1_internet_guide)), but it does not support wireless development.

3. **Q: Is the robot waterproof?**   
    A: No, the G1 is not waterproof.

4. **Q: How often do I need to lubricate the joints?**  
    A: If you encounter motor issues, stiffness or loosening of joints, please contact [Weston Robot Support Team](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=NTNVCC0zFkWzGo_3Vcs_4KxdsbBJKHVIkFlOJLtAMMlUQkJZMU8wM1EyTkRUVUJCVzA2WVdQNzBSMCQlQCN0PWcu&route=shorturl).
    The *Serial Number (SN)* of the robot is located in the battery compartment. The SN (and the *Model*) can also be found in the app in `Device -> Robot Settings`.

5. **Q: What happens when the robot rolls over/falls and does not respond to remote control commands?**   
    A: Check and screenshot the mobile app for any warnings or errors displayed. Power off the robot and carry the robot to a flat and levelled ground. Inspect the robot for any damages (e.g., loose/damaged wiring). Please contact [Weston Robot Support Team](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=NTNVCC0zFkWzGo_3Vcs_4KxdsbBJKHVIkFlOJLtAMMlUQkJZMU8wM1EyTkRUVUJCVzA2WVdQNzBSMCQlQCN0PWcu&route=shorturl) if the robot is unable to be powered on or start up.
