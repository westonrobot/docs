## 3. FAQ

* **Can the ports on the side of the B2 be used?**
    - Yes, the ports on the side of the B2 robot are accessible for use. However, we strongly recommend using the ports located on the User Interface Module whenever possible. This is because using the side ports could compromise the robot's waterproof capabilities. Users are urged to be familiar of the different ports before using them.

* **What is the default speed of the B2 in AI mode?**
    - The default is Low speed. Double click L1 to switch to High Speed.

* **Can the RealSense cameras on the B2 be used for secondary development?**
    - No, the RealSense cameras on the B2 robot are currently not accessible for users to directly control or integrate into their own development projects. These cameras are primarily used by the manufacturer to power the robot's built-in perception features.

* **Can the contact charger be used outdoors?**
    - This contact charger is designed for indoor use. Avoid using it in wet or humid environments to prevent the risk of short circuits. Moisture can damage the charger and potentially pose a safety hazard.

* **What does first foot control and second foot control represent?**
    - First Foot control represents Normal mode, while Second Foot control represents AI mode. When switched on, the B2 is in AI mode (Second Foot control) by default.
