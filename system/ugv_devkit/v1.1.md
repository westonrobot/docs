# V1.1

# Overview

The UGV development kit, together with a robot base, provide a powerful yet flexible mobile robot hardware platform for research and fast prototyping. The kit is designed to be compatible with a wide range of robot bases. Additional components can be easily added on top of the base frame according to application-specific requirements. The platform can be used to implement a wide range of applications, such as autonomous navigation, mapping, and object detection.

![Overview](/img/system/ugv_devkit/v1.1/overview2.png)

This **base configuration** of the development kit consists of the following pre-configured components:

* [NanoPC-based Onboard Computer](/peripheral/computer/nanopc)
* [Weston Robot Power Regulator V2.X](/peripheral/power/power_regulator_v2)
* [Industrial 5G/Wifi Router](/peripheral/network/industrial_5g_router)

Additional computers can be added to the base configuration to support more complex applications:

* Jetson Orin NX
* Mini PC (Intel Core i7)

The following **extension modules** are available to be added to the base configuration:

* [Livox Mid-360 Lidar + IMU](/system/ugv_devkit/v1/mid360_extension)
* [Vision Sensor Kit](/system/ugv_devkit/v1/vision_extension)
* Ouster OS1 Lidar + IMU
* RTK/GNSS Module
* Ultrasonic Sensor Array

Besides the official extension modules, the development kit can be further customized with additional components of your choice. Please feel free to check with us if you have any customization requirements (contact@westonrobot.com).

# Software

We have pre-configured the network settings and installed necessary driver software on the NanoPC-based onboard computer. A few sample applications are also pre-installed to help you get started with the development kit.

## Network

The router is pre-configured to use the IP range 10.10.0.0/24.

The IP addresses are assigned as follows:

| Device Type | IP Range |
|-------------|----------|
| onboard computers | 10.10.0.10-10.10.0.20/24 |
| navigation sensors | 10.10.0.30-10.10.0.40/24 |
| application sensors | 10.10.0.100-10.10.0.120/24 |

It's recommended but not mandatory to follow the above IP assignment rules. You can change the IP addresses according to your requirements. We follow this convention to configure the development kit by default. Please refer to the delivery note for the actual IP assignment on your robot.

## Software Setup

The UGV development kit is pre-installed with the following software stacks:

* ROS2 driver for the robot base and sensors
* [LIO-SAM 3D Mapping Sample Setup](https://github.com/westonrobot/wr_devkit_mapping)
* [ROS2 Navigation Sample Setup](/system/ugv_devkit/v1/nav2_sample_setup_guide)

:::note
1. The ROS drivers are only for components that are part of the base configuration or extension modules supported by Weston Robot.
2. The open-source mapping and navigation stacks are pre-installed **for demonstration purposes and are provided as is**. You can modify the software stack according to your requirements.
